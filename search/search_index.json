Reflections about myself While thinking about this question I thought about myself as an individual and I found that I didn\u2019t have a really remarkable fight. There is a myriad of remarkable fights that are worth fighting for: climate change, loss of biodiversity or others that come to my mind. And I am really worried about the former. I have investigated climate change and refugees, the north and the south global, and the negative impact that the former provokes on the latter. But I don\u2019t feel a real connection with that, nor I did when I started environmental engineering back in my first choice to go to college when I was 17. I feel that this was a fight that needed to be fought, but not by me. I think about that more like a global mission in which I\u2019m involved rather than a personal one. Then, I started to think smaller and with more tangible objectives, and I didn\u2019t find any special topic that I could define as my own fight, except my own survival. After hours and days of feeling like a very static person because of that, I started thinking about replanning the question. What things are you most related to? And so many memories came to my mind. I remembered my family and friend meetings, around the table, and our behavior and habits in these kinds of events: The food, my grandmother, the games we played in the \u201csobremesa\u201d time after lunch\u2026 I never thought about myself as a very traditional person, but recalling memories about my family meetings made me understand the main role tradition plays in life. When we feel out of our comfort zone we go for nostalgia, and that\u2019s where tradition might take place for me. I find myself at a crossroads: should I discard the previous thoughts because they came to my mind only to hold on to something I know or are these thoughts a good entry for something else? On this photograph taken on Christmas in 2020, I was at my grandmother\u2019s home staying at the table after lunch chatting and drinking. The photograph makes me feel like we are a stereotypical Spanish family. Stereotypes are built upon repetitions and habits and they express good and bad qualities around the model they represent. At the time this model iterates enough times it can mutate by idealization into an archetype. In design, we recognize archetypes about almost all objects. These archetypes are constructed by a good design in itself and their repetition during history. We all have an image of what things should be or at least how many elements these things have. Going back to my grandmother\u2019s photograph I found a little thing that surprise me. She designs a photo frame using her little clock. This clock has a perfect size, inclination angle and shapes to attach my grandmother\u2019s photograph. This frame was a non-intentional design, an object that works behind its use. FIRST PERSPECTIVE All the things that surround us are involved in the system we are designing for, is the ecosystem and context we are designing with. One of the implications in the sentence above is about taking the context as a partner, as an active agent in the design process, and use it as a tool. In first perspective approach I have to put myself in context. At first, I have to reflect about whats my vision, to develop this vision we did a personal development plan. This plan relates what I am now and what I want to be to materialized through actions where I want to lead. POBLENOU TOUR We visited some places in Poblenou that make us realized how the neighborhood works and its community. Also made me start to observe in points of view related to what we did at the beginning of the week. These are some non-intentional designs I found in the streets.","title":"Bootcamp"},{"location":"seminars/01-Bootcamp/#bootcamp","text":"","title":"Bootcamp"},{"location":"seminars/01-Bootcamp/#whats-your-fight","text":"","title":"WHAT'S YOUR FIGHT?"},{"location":"seminars/01-Bootcamp/#reflections-about-myself","text":"While thinking about this question I thought about myself as an individual and I found that I didn\u2019t have a really remarkable fight.

Stevens and Laurent Duchatelet In this paper the authors studied the bioluminescence in three species of deepwater sharks. The dissertation describes the bioluminiscence\u2019s causes, how these shark\u2019s cells can produce light, and the ability of those species to control light emission. The main reason attributed to bioluminescence is Counterillumination, with some exceptions like aposematism, and conspecific recognition. Luminescence is achieved by an amount of photophores that are located in the epidermis. Each organ \u2013photophore\u2013 is made of an aggregate of photocytes. Photocytes are photogenic cells where a biochemical reaction takes place, and are covered with a layer of pigmented cells. The reaction starts with the molecule luciferin\u2019s oxidation by an enzyme, the luciferase, or through a stabilized complex called photoprotein. Photophores also display an iris-like structure (ILS) composed of chromatophores between the photocytes and the lens cells. The interesting part arrives when the light changes by hormonal control. In this experiment the authors test the effect of MT (melatonin), \u03b1-MSH and ACTH in the light changes. Also Prolactin triggers light in one of the species. The trial was done by immersion of skin patches in different concentrations of the different hormones. The hormone MT increases the light and the \u03b1-MSH and ACTH make inhibitory actions to the light. Luminescence was measured using FB12 tube-luminometer and the lights emissions were recorded through a multiple kinetics software. Since Edison created the first commercially practical incandescent light, our lives are attached to the light, increasing our time awake and improving our lives in different ways, but do we need that all those lights came from non-renewable resources? Is it possible to apply this literacy to redesign our habits? Can we interact with other species in the domestic space? Ambio- Teresa van Dongen Design a mutant I started with one simple question: It\u2019s possible to use photocytes or photoproteins to use them on screens? When I was looking in the background research phase I found that some scientifics had developed LED\u00b4s with fluorescent proteins \u201cto use as a backlight source for liquid crystal (LC) displays\u201d. Those proteins are eGFP (green fluorescent protein) and mCherry (red fluorescent protein). \u201cThe expression and purification of the proteins were done in six steps, which were: transformation, induction, cell harvest, lysis, purification and concentration.\u201d After that, they integrated these proteins on blue LED chips to generate white light. mCherry It\u2019s interesting how this biotechnological progress allows us to improve different aspects of life. Using fluorescent proteins in LEDs reduces e-waste but, Can we make biodegradable light in all of its aspects? Hypothesis: Through 3D impression it\u2019s possible to print a luminous organ and control light with a hormone system. A photophore is a glandular organ that appears as luminous spots. Taking a sample of this organ from the corresponding animal and cultivating the different cells from this organ, I will be able to print in 3D replicating the same structural characteristics and functions of the organ sample. In order to improve the emission of light, I can modify the genes that are responsible for synthesizing the photoproteins by CRISPR Cas9. Through an array with the modified cells from this organ, I 3D print it. This new organ in an appropriate environment could be modified with a hormonal system with MT, \u03b1-MSH, and ACTH. This hormonal system immerses the organ in a specific concentration of each hormone in order to \u201cturn off\u201d, \u201cturn on\u201d, and change the light intensity.
