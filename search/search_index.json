Reflections about myself While thinking about this question I thought about myself as an individual and I found that I didn\u2019t have a really remarkable fight. There is a myriad of remarkable fights that are worth fighting for: climate change, loss of biodiversity or others that come to my mind. And I am really worried about the former. I have investigated climate change and refugees, the north and the south global, and the negative impact that the former provokes on the latter. But I don\u2019t feel a real connection with that, nor I did when I started environmental engineering back in my first choice to go to college when I was 17. I feel that this was a fight that needed to be fought, but not by me. I think about that more like a global mission in which I\u2019m involved rather than a personal one. Then, I started to think smaller and with more tangible objectives, and I didn\u2019t find any special topic that I could define as my own fight, except my own survival. After hours and days of feeling like a very static person because of that, I started thinking about replanning the question. What things are you most related to? And so many memories came to my mind. I remembered my family and friend meetings, around the table, and our behavior and habits in these kinds of events: The food, my grandmother, the games we played in the \u201csobremesa\u201d time after lunch\u2026 I never thought about myself as a very traditional person, but recalling memories about my family meetings made me understand the main role tradition plays in life. When we feel out of our comfort zone we go for nostalgia, and that\u2019s where tradition might take place for me. I find myself at a crossroads: should I discard the previous thoughts because they came to my mind only to hold on to something I know or are these thoughts a good entry for something else? On this photograph taken on Christmas in 2020, I was at my grandmother\u2019s home staying at the table after lunch chatting and drinking. The photograph makes me feel like we are a stereotypical Spanish family. Stereotypes are built upon repetitions and habits and they express good and bad qualities around the model they represent. At the time this model iterates enough times it can mutate by idealization into an archetype. In design, we recognize archetypes about almost all objects. These archetypes are constructed by a good design in itself and their repetition during history. We all have an image of what things should be or at least how many elements these things have. Going back to my grandmother\u2019s photograph I found a little thing that surprise me. She designs a photo frame using her little clock. This clock has a perfect size, inclination angle and shapes to attach my grandmother\u2019s photograph. This frame was a non-intentional design, an object that works behind its use. FIRST PERSPECTIVE All the things that surround us are involved in the system we are designing for, is the ecosystem and context we are designing with. One of the implications in the sentence above is about taking the context as a partner, as an active agent in the design process, and use it as a tool. In first perspective approach I have to put myself in context. At first, I have to reflect about whats my vision, to develop this vision we did a personal development plan. This plan relates what I am now and what I want to be to materialized through actions where I want to lead. POBLENOU TOUR We visited some places in Poblenou that make us realized how the neighborhood works and its community. Also made me start to observe in points of view related to what we did at the beginning of the week. These are some non-intentional designs I found in the streets.","title":"Bootcamp"},{"location":"seminars/01-Bootcamp/#bootcamp","text":"","title":"Bootcamp"},{"location":"seminars/01-Bootcamp/#whats-your-fight","text":"","title":"WHAT'S YOUR FIGHT?"},{"location":"seminars/01-Bootcamp/#reflections-about-myself","text":"While thinking about this question I thought about myself as an individual and I found that I didn\u2019t have a really remarkable fight.

At first I tried to make a defamiliarization of the domestic things, so I thought that things were my point, but when the day started I realized that the spaces where I placed the \u201cnew\u201d things also were affected because the actions I played with the objects. Also I thought only about domestic things but it changed when I started thinking about bringing outside things as domestic ones. So finally the experiment blurred the limits by itself. Authenticity, construct validity, being personally involved. I lived one day in an upside down home, all activities changed and I prefered just taking some photos and short videos in order to not change these activities because of the documentation. In some moments I forgot that I was in the middle of an experiment and found myself looking for things in the wrong place and sometimes reality just came into my mind and I realized that I was reading on the sink or eating surrounded by plants. Plausibility or scholarship, it relates to current research, trends\u2026 People\u2019s behaviour is very related to the things that surround themselves. Design and adding new technologies in domestic spaces have an impact in people\u2019s lives, so it\u2019s important to remember our habits and feel those rituals or things that we normally don\u2019t notice. Also the experiment brings me the opportunity to see how I pack things. What are the links between things and why?. I put one thing out of context and by using this thing some other things appear around the first object I put. I noticed that the objects built a network and I could see it by making this network obvious. Criticality, instrumental utility, imagining ways of thinking and acting differently. I think this experiment can be done in several ways, the three ways I played and so many others, make things strange by mixing them, put in the outside some from the inside\u2026 Self-revealing communication, communicate in an open and transparent way without filtering or changing what happened. In the video I didn\u2019t show all the things that happened because I was really into the experiment and forgot to document all the actions I made. But I analyzed those actions after the experiment in a more theoretical way. Ethnographic material with confessional content, personal material to be limited to relevant information in relation to the research subject. I am embodied in research about data, habits, things and consumerism so I chose this experiment in order to give some clarity to the theoretical research I had been doing until this point. To experiment some ways where I could start to design and challenge the theory that I already study. Absurdity and new relations between things were already some topics that I wanted to explore. I think that some Insights are going to help me a lot in the future. Generalizability, does it relate to others? I think that it can be meaningful to others because \u201cthings\u201d or objects were not a close space. Waste and the ways we waste are also habits related to things. Also it\u2019s important the behaviour we have and in which spaces.
