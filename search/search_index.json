Reflections about myself While thinking about this question I thought about myself as an individual and I found that I didn\u2019t have a really remarkable fight. There is a myriad of remarkable fights that are worth fighting for: climate change, loss of biodiversity or others that come to my mind. And I am really worried about the former. I have investigated climate change and refugees, the north and the south global, and the negative impact that the former provokes on the latter. But I don\u2019t feel a real connection with that, nor I did when I started environmental engineering back in my first choice to go to college when I was 17. I feel that this was a fight that needed to be fought, but not by me. I think about that more like a global mission in which I\u2019m involved rather than a personal one. Then, I started to think smaller and with more tangible objectives, and I didn\u2019t find any special topic that I could define as my own fight, except my own survival. After hours and days of feeling like a very static person because of that, I started thinking about replanning the question. What things are you most related to? And so many memories came to my mind. I remembered my family and friend meetings, around the table, and our behavior and habits in these kinds of events: The food, my grandmother, the games we played in the \u201csobremesa\u201d time after lunch\u2026 I never thought about myself as a very traditional person, but recalling memories about my family meetings made me understand the main role tradition plays in life. When we feel out of our comfort zone we go for nostalgia, and that\u2019s where tradition might take place for me. I find myself at a crossroads: should I discard the previous thoughts because they came to my mind only to hold on to something I know or are these thoughts a good entry for something else? On this photograph taken on Christmas in 2020, I was at my grandmother\u2019s home staying at the table after lunch chatting and drinking. The photograph makes me feel like we are a stereotypical Spanish family. Stereotypes are built upon repetitions and habits and they express good and bad qualities around the model they represent. At the time this model iterates enough times it can mutate by idealization into an archetype. In design, we recognize archetypes about almost all objects. These archetypes are constructed by a good design in itself and their repetition during history. We all have an image of what things should be or at least how many elements these things have. Going back to my grandmother\u2019s photograph I found a little thing that surprise me. She designs a photo frame using her little clock. This clock has a perfect size, inclination angle and shapes to attach my grandmother\u2019s photograph. This frame was a non-intentional design, an object that works behind its use. FIRST PERSPECTIVE All the things that surround us are involved in the system we are designing for, is the ecosystem and context we are designing with. One of the implications in the sentence above is about taking the context as a partner, as an active agent in the design process, and use it as a tool. In first perspective approach I have to put myself in context. At first, I have to reflect about whats my vision, to develop this vision we did a personal development plan. This plan relates what I am now and what I want to be to materialized through actions where I want to lead. After collecting and summarizing these points we met each other to see our points of attraction or repulsion. These meetings help me to focus and place my own identity inside the context and to start to see synergies between us. My personal vision The uncertainty about the future is a usual source of fear. We cannot separate our perception of the present from our expectations about the future. Climate change, mass consumption, or the dizzying development of tech without an ethical background are some of the challenges that we have to face. As an agent that design things that have agency and affect the world, designers have the role of being conscious about all processes and the tracks that these \u201cthings\u201d left both behind and forward. Society is undergoing a paradigms shift. We can compare this change with industrialization, back then the change was principally driven by economy and profit. At this moment, designers will have a chance to drive shift and lay the groundwork for new realities to come.

Stevens and Laurent Duchatelet In this paper the authors studied the bioluminescence in three species of deepwater sharks. The dissertation describes the bioluminiscence\u2019s causes, how these shark\u2019s cells can produce light, and the ability of those species to control light emission. The main reason attributed to bioluminescence is Counterillumination, with some exceptions like aposematism, and conspecific recognition. Luminescence is achieved by an amount of photophores that are located in the epidermis. Each organ \u2013photophore\u2013 is made of an aggregate of photocytes. Photocytes are photogenic cells where a biochemical reaction takes place, and are covered with a layer of pigmented cells. The reaction starts with the molecule luciferin\u2019s oxidation by an enzyme, the luciferase, or through a stabilized complex called photoprotein. Photophores also display an iris-like structure (ILS) composed of chromatophores between the photocytes and the lens cells. The interesting part arrives when the light changes by hormonal control. In this experiment the authors test the effect of MT (melatonin), \u03b1-MSH and ACTH in the light changes. Also Prolactin triggers light in one of the species. The trial was done by immersion of skin patches in different concentrations of the different hormones. The hormone MT increases the light and the \u03b1-MSH and ACTH make inhibitory actions to the light. Luminescence was measured using FB12 tube-luminometer and the lights emissions were recorded through a multiple kinetics software. Since Edison created the first commercially practical incandescent light, our lives are attached to the light, increasing our time awake and improving our lives in different ways, but do we need that all those lights came from non-renewable resources? Is it possible to apply this literacy to redesign our habits? Can we interact with other species in the domestic space? Ambio- Teresa van Dongen Design a mutant iGEM I started with one simple question: It\u2019s possible to use photocytes or photoproteins to use them on screens? When I was looking in the background research phase I found that some scientifics had developed LED\u00b4s with fluorescent proteins \u201cto use as a backlight source for liquid crystal (LC) displays\u201d. Those proteins are eGFP (green fluorescent protein) and mCherry (red fluorescent protein). \u201cThe expression and purification of the proteins were done in six steps, which were: transformation, induction, cell harvest, lysis, purification and concentration.\u201d After that, they integrated these proteins on blue LED chips to generate white light. mCherry It\u2019s interesting how this biotechnological progress allows us to improve different aspects of life. Using fluorescent proteins in LEDs reduces e-waste but, Can we make biodegradable light in all of its aspects? Hypothesis: Through 3D impression it\u2019s possible to print a luminous organ and control light with a hormone system. A photophore is a glandular organ that appears as luminous spots. Taking a sample of this organ from the corresponding animal and cultivating the different cells from this organ, I will be able to print in 3D replicating the same structural characteristics and functions of the organ sample. In order to improve the emission of light, I can modify the genes that are responsible for synthesizing the photoproteins by CRISPR Cas9. Through an array with the modified cells from this organ, I 3D print it. This new organ in an appropriate environment could be modified with a hormonal system with MT, \u03b1-MSH, and ACTH. This hormonal system immerses the organ in a specific concentration of each hormone in order to \u201cturn off\u201d, \u201cturn on\u201d, and change the light intensity.

This model has an optical unit or CD/DVD ROM that can reproduce and burn cd/dvd. This could be used for playing videos or movies. This computer has a WIFI modem, so it can be connected to the internet. It had an Intel processor and 8 GB of RAM. It have a monitor and 3 USB ports, 2 input/output for audio and video, and Ethernet port This device could be used for personal use or work. Conclusions It was all different kinds of functions and its parts combined in one box. Each functional part was connected to the motherboard with plugs in. Most of the parts are made by different suppliers. Camera, speakers, disc utility, microphone, and hard drive are easy to recognize. When we accidentally dropped the CPU to the floor, it bent and was unable to be used again. Some parts are really fragile when it\u2019s open. There are more than 100 screws used inside. Most of the metal parts are aluminum. Metals are both manufactured by stamping, the stand might be molded. Plastic parts(box) are coated polycarbonate. Everything except the screen is covered with an aluminium sheet in order to avoid heat and radiation. Some screws are hidden and some parts are glued so that Apple technical support will be able to know if a user opens the computer by themself so that Apple will not support it anymore.

Hypothesis: - Lunch&Afternoon Data \u201cThere is a space for a (covid-safe) lunch?\u201d - Morning Data \u201cAre there people in Iaac interested in having a space to have lunch?\u201d Recollecting Data We used the PiCamera to record Iaac spaces in two different ways: The camera was taking pictures while we moved around the different spaces of IAAC. Static timelapse: the camera was place in the entrance and captured everything that happened there. For the camera settings, we decided to use a low resolution (320x240px). Poster at the entrance to see how people react. Data summary Almost useless machine: A3P2 The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. In A3P2 we worked to develop the structure, the mechanics, and the code according to our skills and the short amount of time we had to design the prototype. Assembling the pieces I realized that the vertical movement or the light system with fiber optics in which I\u2019d been immersed were more than only mechanics and materials, they were a system. Once we had the robot working we couldn\u2019t stop projecting human skills to it. At first, we design a machine to feel an emotion by using it, but in the end, I feel that we design a machine to express this emotion. A3P2.mp4 from paula del rio arteaga on Vimeo .

We learned basic concepts about the architecture of neural networks and their types. We also understood the process of the AI concept in history and how we have been pushing one step further that \u201cintelligence\u201d associated to the machine each time a technological advance was achieved. One of the exercises we had to do was take 100 photos of Poblenou neighborhood, 50 of them of something related to the old Poblenou and 50 with the new one. Also, we had to upload 100 random photos from our phones. Base on these two sets, the professors would generate a map for classifying the images and generate new ones. A photo association that I found interesting; the association between shapes and content made the AI put together a Petri dish and a breakfast. The photos were mapped by visual similarity with machine learning. These are a group of images generated by the AI from the photos of Poblenou. Then we started using projects on Google Colab including image identification and generation, latent space, and deep fake. The AI generated new faces based on the datasets and we could modify them with parameters. The steps of modification start from an average face with a \u201cno gender\u201d expression and in each step become more strange. One thing I found interesting in those projects is mixing two faces. I uploaded a random photograph and I mix it with Lisa Simpson, and the output was a realistic photo with the man but with some yellow tones. So he seems to be ill.
