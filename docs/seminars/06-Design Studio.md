**RESEARCH THROUGH DESIGN TOOLBOX**

The prototype as a means of inquiry for me seems to be one of the most attractive ways to prototype, as well as the prototype as a research archetype. As I could see in my toolbox I have so many physical and digital things around me and attached to them my behaviors. I wanted to make a physical interface that allows me to change my perception of the moment between I go to bed and I fall asleep.
