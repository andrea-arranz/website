**Bioluminescence of the Largest Luminous Vertebrate, the Kitefin Shark, Dalatias licha: First Insights and Comparative Aspects**

Jérôme Mallefet, Darren W. Stevens and Laurent Duchatelet

In this paper the authors studied the bioluminescence in three species of deepwater sharks. The dissertation describes the bioluminiscence’s causes, how these shark’s cells can produce light, and the ability of those species to control light emission.

The main reason attributed to bioluminescence is Counterillumination, with some exceptions like aposematism, and conspecific recognition. 

Luminescence is achieved by an amount of photophores that are located in the epidermis. Each organ –photophore– is made of an aggregate of photocytes. Photocytes are photogenic cells where a biochemical reaction takes place, and are covered with a layer of pigmented cells. The reaction starts with the molecule luciferin’s oxidation by an enzyme, the luciferase, or through a stabilized complex called photoprotein. Photophores also display an iris-like structure (ILS) composed of chromatophores between the photocytes and the lens cells.

The interesting part arrives when the light changes by hormonal control. In this experiment the authors test the effect of MT (melatonin), α-MSH and ACTH in the light changes. Also Prolactin triggers light in one of the species. 

The trial was done by immersion of skin patches in different concentrations of the different hormones. The hormone MT increases the light and the α-MSH and ACTH make inhibitory actions to the light. Luminescence was measured using FB12 tube-luminometer and the lights emissions were recorded through a multiple kinetics software. 

Since Edison created the first commercially practical incandescent light, our lives are attached to the light, increasing our time awake and improving our lives in different ways, but do we need that all those lights came from non-renewable resources? Is it possible to apply this literacy to redesign our habits? Can we interact with other species in the domestic space?
