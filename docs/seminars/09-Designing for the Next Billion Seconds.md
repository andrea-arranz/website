#**Designing for the NexT Billion Seconds**
##What futures do we want to remember one billion seconds from now?

We start the week with a simple question, what is the future for you?
I always had to think about the future like a cone. Always someone had shown me the following image as a tool to understand better how to imagine the future as a designer.

Now that someone asks me about what's the future I realize that I never asked myself that easy question that can change all. I answer: "The future is the human projection of being". Later on, I have preferred to change "begin" for "becoming".
We live in a super complex system is why we have to find relationships between concepts that allow us to make alternative narratives, a subversion of paradoxes. 
We have to reimagine our future's imaginaries. To do that, we can start with the language. Words are so meaningful, changing a word could implicate a different way to understand a sentence or an idea. Another tool that we developed after was the design of storytelling. 
**How will be my life on a regular day in a billion seconds from now?**

With the presentation of our routines, we were able to identify patterns as common fears, desires, or priorities, even though we have different backgrounds and cultures. Those patterns are signals of our desirables o non-desirables futures and a track in our collective imaginaries. 

Questions as a tool to generate new insights around the *futures* and to make better questions. [*The Everything manifesto*](https://www.iam-internet.com/everything) make ten hypothetical questions around those topics: Identity, Time, Problems, Scale, Growth, Energy, Business models, Decisions, Learning and Design.
