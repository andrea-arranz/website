#**Designing for the NexT Billion Seconds**
##What futures do we want to remember one billion seconds from now?

We start the week with a simple question, what is the future for you?
I always had to think about the future like a cone. Always someone had shown me the following image as a tool to understand better how to imagine the future as a designer.

Now that someone asks me about what's the future I realize that I never asked myself that easy question that can change all. I answer: "The future is the human projection of being". Later on, I have preferred to change "begin" for "becoming".
We live in a super complex system is why we have to find relationships between concepts that allow us to make alternative narratives, a subversion of paradoxes. 
We have to reimagine our future's imaginaries. To do that, we can start with the language. Words are so meaningful, changing a word could implicate a different way to understand a sentence or an idea. Another tool that we developed after was the design of storytelling. **How will be my life on a regular day in a billion seconds from now?**
